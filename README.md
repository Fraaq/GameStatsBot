## üíéCommands

**!add_server** (Add game server to the database) | Required role to use this command is **games server manager**  
**!del_server** (Delete server from the database) | Required role to use this command is **games server manager**    
**!servers** (List of all servers from the database)   
**!info** (Stored information about the server from the database)   
**!players** (All players of the server with their names, scores and playtime)   
**!stats** (Stats of the server like game, name, description, map, player count, map thumbnail)   

## üõ†Ô∏èHow to customize the bot
* ### Add thumbnails
  * Your map thumbnail file should be named exactly as the map name (de_mirage.jpg)
  * Upload your thumbnail to the [map-thumbnails/your-game-name/](map-thumbnails)
* ### Add thumbnails for more games
  * You need to create new folder in [map-thumbnails/](map-thumbnails) and the folder should have name exactly
    same as your game name without this characters \\, /, :, *, ?, ", <, >, |   
    If you don't know exactly the game name you can write !stats and the name is in field game.
  * For example if my game is CS2 I will write !stats and there is this name: Counter-Strike 2 
    I will remove the special characters so my game folder inside [map-thumbnails/](map-thumbnails) should look
    like this map-thumbnails/Counter-Strike 2
  
* ### Help messages
  * Edit help messages in [help_messages.json](help_messages.json).
* ### Discord role for managing servers
  * Edit this string ```DISCORD_MANAGE_ROLE``` in [validators.py](validators.py).
